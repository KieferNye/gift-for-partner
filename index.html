        <p>Hello, honey. The time I have spent with you has been the best of my life. You are the light of my life, and I couldn't imagine it without you. You make me want to plan a future I never thought I'd have. You truly are the best thing that has ever happened to me. I wanted to make you something that you could always look back at and see and remind yourself of my love for you. I know that time will pass, and we will have our struggles, but throughout everything, my love for you will only grow stronger. Every moment with you is a cherished memory, and I can't wait to make even more with you. I want this to be another part of the ever-growing tree of our lives. This is for you, always.</p>
